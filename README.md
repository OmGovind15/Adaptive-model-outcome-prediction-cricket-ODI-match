# Adaptive-model-outcome-prediction-cricket-ODI-match

The dataset is taken from https://cricsheet.org/matches/

 The work is being done on following two points: 
 
 1. Use of different ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, etc. to make
 binary as well as soft predictions of the winner of the match

 2. Switching of models over-wise as the match progresses based on their cross validation score.
 3. Feature Selection
 4. Shap values (with reference to neural network only)
 5. comparisons between trainign separately for each over data, trainig together all the overs, and feature slection impact innings wise
